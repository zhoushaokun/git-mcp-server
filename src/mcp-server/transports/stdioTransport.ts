/**
 * Handles the setup and connection for the Stdio MCP transport.
 * Implements the MCP Specification 2025-03-26 for stdio transport.
 * This transport communicates directly over standard input (stdin) and
 * standard output (stdout), typically used when the MCP server is launched
 * as a child process by a host application.
 *
 * Specification Reference:
 * https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/docs/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports.mdx#stdio
 *
 * --- Authentication Note ---
 * As per the MCP Authorization Specification (2025-03-26, Section 1.2),
 * STDIO transports SHOULD NOT implement HTTP-based authentication flows.
 * Authorization is typically handled implicitly by the host application
 * controlling the server process. This implementation follows that guideline.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/docs/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization.mdx | MCP Authorization Specification}

 *
 * MCP Spec Points Covered by SDK's StdioServerTransport:
 * - Reads JSON-RPC messages (requests, notifications, responses, batches) from stdin.
 * - Writes JSON-RPC messages to stdout.
 * - Handles newline delimiters and ensures no embedded newlines in output messages.
 * - Ensures only valid MCP messages are written to stdout.
 *
 * Note: Logging via the `logger` utility MAY result in output to stderr, which is
 * permitted by the spec for logging purposes.
 *
 * @param {McpServer} server - The McpServer instance containing the core logic (tools, resources).
 * @param {Record<string, any>} context - Logging context for correlation.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the connection is successfully established.
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the connection fails during setup (e.g., issues connecting server to transport).
